### About
This is a safe space to chat with an emotional support buddy, keep yourself on track with daily checklists (no matter how small), and scream your thoughts out when you need to.

### Tech
Front End:
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
Back End:
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>JSON</li>
</ul>

### Future Plans
In the future, we would like to continue our work on finishing the ChatBot and integrating it with our UI. We would also like to explore more customization such as picking from one of many emotional support buddy avatars/names and color themes. Additionally, we would like to implement a database to add a Tracker page where you can track your moods, progress towards goals, and health statistics (hours of sleep, liters of water drank, etc).
